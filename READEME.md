## WORK

1. I have started this page by inporting the boostrap inside the html file and also in the javascript file to allow the dynamics to occur.

2. The second step was importing from the bootsrap website a nav bar. I have costumised the bar on my liking design using boostrap classes.

3. In the next step I created a jumbotron containing my pictures and few thing about myself. I have used boostrap to that.

4. After the hero section, a work section has been created using bootsrap grids and cards for each project.

5. The about me and contact me have been placed togeder in the same raw using bootstrap grid

6. Finaly a footer has been added which contains a link to my github and also an image/icon that takes you to the top of the page.
