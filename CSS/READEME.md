## WORK

1. I have started this page by inporting the boostrap inside the html file and also in the javascript file to allow the dynamics to occur.

2. The second step was importing from the bootsrap website a nav bar. I have costumised the bar on my liking design using boostrap classes.

3. In the next step I created a jumbotron containing my pictures and few thing about myself. I have used boostrap to that.
